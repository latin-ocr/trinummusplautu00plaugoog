xxvi INTRODUGTION

like the Miles Gloriosus, it is greatly in exoess of its iambie
rival. As the latter is the favorite verse for opening a
play, so the troehaio septenarius is generally used at the
close.

Diaeresis is usual after the fourth foot, whioh may ex-
hibit hiatus aud syllaba auceps. Sometimes the diaeresis
eomes at the eud ol the fifth foot, in which ease there is
often a seooudary diaeresis or caesura. The seventh foot is
usually a pure troohee, but is sometimes a tribraeh. Lines

345-348 are thus scanned: -

Pol pudere quam pigere praestat totidem litteris.

Edepol de‘um uirtute dicam, pater, et maiorum et tua
Multa bona bene parua) habemus: bene si amieo feceris,
Ne pigeat feciss(e): ut potius pudeat, si non feceris.

37. Taocuaro OerorrAarus (Tetrometer Acotoieetie). —A
single instance of this verse is found in the Trinouantes, via:
at 251, ina lyrioal system. The line in question has four
diaereses. ·

3. Anaransrre

38. The anapaestis meter is very common iu the cantico
of Plautus. For the anapaest (o o L) may be substituted
, the spondee (- L), daotyl (Aa υ), and sometimes the ppo
celeusmatis (υ υ ό υ). In Plautus, however, we also find
feeioffivemorael (- υ -ι - υ υ υ, υ υ υ -s υ --) used

“irrationally'⁷ for the anapaest. Thus turbines (835), ouant
(arn) horni-(1115)‚sotillites(833),(ia)probisvi-(2l5a). These J

lh mora is the duration ol a short syllable, taken as the unit ol
measure. ⁴

xx INTRODUCTION

The shortened long may be (a) a monosyllable, (b) the long

syllable of an ¹iambie word, (o) the first syllable of a dis-

syllabio οι· polysyllabio word, (d) the second syllable of a

polysyllable. The following are examples from ‘the Triss >

nummus:-

(α) midai) in manu (104); qrrdd dd uentrem (482);

(b) duim tu (61); edne (513); puter mellto (361);

(c) ttbli) istaec (77); dum) werinberti (137); qudd &coibit
<uvis

(d) dedistr'ne (129); senectuti (398); toberudeulo (726).

15. Other peculiarities of early Latin versification are
the following:-

16. Fiual s after a short vowel was weakly sounded and
therefore suoh au s, followed by a consonant, usually fails
to make position3 ey. pratis quom (198), rectoque (234), nacuyis
habet (275).

17. Contrary to the later rulo, a syllable ending in a
short vowel before a mute, followed by lor r, is not ‘eom-
mon,' but remeius short; eq. doro (616).

18. Certain final syllables whioh beoame short in later
timeS, still retain in Plautus the original long quantity.
Thus :- ’

(α) -ot, -et, -r't, in many verb forms, as dicor, dicebat, diret,
dixit, diroerit¹ ; eg. aydt (842), hebet (206).

(b) etr and -or in verbal forms, as dicor, dicum· and -er and
-or in substantives and comparative adjectives, as
morer, orator, boylon· ef. exercitor (226).

· (o) occasional oases like eris (971) are due to syllaba orrceps

at a pause in the verse.
(d) eqo as well as eqd is found in Plautus3 of. 173, 282.
19. llven in places where the lambio law does not apply,
the words ille and nempe often show the apparent scansion

1 But not (eq.) dicu, or futures in -u, as eri* errabit.

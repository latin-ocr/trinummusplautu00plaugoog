27. In one respect a Latin comedy resembled amodern
opera. A large proportion of each play was either sung cr
recited to a musical accompaniment. Scenes which were
merely spoken and involved no musical clement were known
as diverbia. These were the soenes composed in iambic
senarii.

28. Scenes into which a musical clement entered were of
two kinds. They were either (a) declaimed in recitative
style, with flute accompaniurent,'01·(b) they were actually
sung to set tunes. Both of these kinds of scenes were
known as cantica. The former (a) were composed either in
trochaio septenarii, iambic septenarii, or iambic octonarii.

The latter (b) were distinctly lyrical sceneS, composed in a ,

variety of meters, including not only the more unusual
oues, but also those mentioned in connection with (a), the
merely recited cantica.

29. The iambic (υ -) and trochaic (.. υ), as¹ well as
anapaestic (υ υ -), meters of Roman comedy take their ‚
strict Latin names -ap acuamur, septenarius, octonarius-
from the number of individual feet which each line contains.
In Greek poetry, however, these mensures are based upon
units of dipodies, or combinations of two feet, whence a line
· cf four feet is known as a dimeter, one of six feet as a tri-
meter, and so on. In an iambic dipody (υ - o -) the
Greeks allowed the substitution of a spondae (- -) cr a
dactyl (- o υ) for an iambus only in the first half, just as
in a trochaic dipody (- υ - υ) the corresponding substitu-
tions of spondeo and anapaest (υ υ -) were allowed only in
the second half. The disregard of this rule, or the loss cf
distinction between odd and even feet, constitutos the main
metrica] difference between Latin and Greek comedy. In

5. But assuming that Terence, dimidiatas Menander,l
mirrors most faithfully the tone and ensenrble effect cf the
N ew Attio Comedy, we cannot suppose, in view of the great
differenee which the most superficial reader must deteet be-
tween him and Plautus, that the earlier writer strictly con-
fined himself to any one field. We must, indeed, believe
that in the Plautino plays the author made use of all the
dramatic resources within his reach. His literary activity
began toward the end oi the Second Punic War, and it was
shortly after 211 111. that the Atellanoe² were introduced
into Rome. It is highly probable that these popular per-
formances suggested to Plautus much of the broad farce
and audacious roguery which fill his plays. Horace, who
was no admirer of Plautus, calls him a very Dossennus, ·

Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus in parasitis (Epist. 2. 1. 173)

and the nornen itseli of the author is by some derived frorn
another ¹stock character in the Atellan farce, vin: Maccus,
the buffoon. The careless haste to which Horace refers in =
the same passage -

Quam non adstricto percurrat pulpita socco

is probably due quite as mrrch to the influence of inartistic

lTerence is so styled by Julius Caesar, in an epigram which begins: -
Tu qnoque tuin summis, 0 dimidiate Menander,
Poneris, et merito, puri sermonis amator.

Menander was the chief representative oi the New Attio Conredy, which
fiourished from about 336 ao. (the date oi the accession oi Alexander the
Great) to 250 ac. We possess only fragments oi his work, but recent

discoveries in Egypt have made very substantial additions to these.

²Tne fabulae Atellanae received their name irorn Atella, an Oscan town
in Campania. The Atellan iarce set icrth in burlesque the life oi villages,
and at an early time the characters followed fixed types. Maccus, 111111-

ample, is a simpleton or buffcon; Bucco, a chattering iool; Pappus‚ avain ’
. old rnau; and Dossennus, a sly villain. Though the plots were pre

arranged, the dialogue was largely improvised.

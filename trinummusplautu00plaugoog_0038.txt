INTRODUOTION xxxiii

but Lesbonicus will consent tothe marriage only ou condition
³ that a small pieoe of land, the last remnant of his fortune,
be taken ior his sister's marriage-portion. This proposal
excites great alarin on the part of Stasimus, the faithful
slave of Lesbonicus, who does his best to dissuade Philto
from accepting the land. Lysiteles himself pleads with Les·
’ bonicus not to persist in his folly, but the latter is obdurate.

Meanwhile Callicles, who has learned from Stasimus what
is going on, confers with Megaronides, and together they
devise a plan for providing adower froin the hidden treasure
without exciting the suspicions of Lesbonicus. For a small
sum they hire a sycophanta or professional impostor, who is
to pretend that he is a messenger from Charmides. He is
to bring with him letters, one of which, directed to Les-
bonious, is to inform the young man that Charmides is send-
ing money to Callicles, to be used as adower for· his sister. ’
In reality, the money is to be dug up within the house.

By an extraordinary coincidence, Charmides, returning
unexpectedly from abroad, meets the impostor before his
own door. The scene, which is extremely amusing, ends
with the complete discomfiture of the impostor. Then
Stasimus appears and, recognizing his old master, informs
him of all that has taken place in his absence, including the
supposed treachery of Callicles, wh0, however, in a few
words explains his conduct to his old friend’s satisfaction.
Arrangements are now quiekly made for the marriage. Les-
boniensis forgiven and, at his father’s request, marries the

daughter of Callicles.

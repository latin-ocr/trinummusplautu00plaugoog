6. ll'uasus Rurzrnrrus¹

41. This composite rerse¹ consists usually of the iambis
dimeter followed by an unbrokeu rhythmioal phrase. This
phrase is known as the Goion Reizianuru, and exhibits a
great variety of forms, comprising five, six, or seven sylla
bles The instances in the Trinummus, to which may be
added 240, 247, 281, referred to iu the next paragraph, are
the following (the Colon Reizianum alone being scanned) : 2*

236. qu(em) ad mod(um) expediant , u - υ υ ,,
254. inops amator υ - u ,, -

259. satis quod aegre sit v u υ - , ,,
285. ut sit sui similis , , - v υ .-

7. Anouro D1ronr

42. The Adonio Dipody (L o υ Ι L υ), familiar to us
from the Sapphio Stanza of Horace, is used in combination
with other rhythms. Plautus resolves the long syllable into
two short ones. ln the ratramnus this clausula is used with
Cretio Dimeters (248, 250) and also with lambio Dimeters,
instead of the Colon Reiziauum (240, 247, 281).

1 So named from Reiz, ascholar who lived early in the niueteenth century.

2 As the Golon is of quite indeterminate character, no ictus is marked.

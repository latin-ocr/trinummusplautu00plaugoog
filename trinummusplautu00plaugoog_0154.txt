APPENDIX ·

The extant Mss. of Plautus are of two families. The only
representative of one is the Codes Ambrosianus, known as Α, of
the fourth century su, written in Capitale.¹ The other Mss.
belong to the Palatine family, which is known collectively as Ρ,
andare written in minuscule script The oldest belongs to the
end of the tenth century. '

In the following notes, we have cited all important variations
between the editions of Leo (1896) and Lindsay (1903), as well as
the few cases where this edition accords with neither.

31-33. Thus Mss. Leo follows Biicheler in transposing 32 and 33.

51. tuoopil: Leo with A. Lindsay prefers cyil tuo, with P.

72-74. Leo rejects not only 72o (not given by A), but also 73
and 74, partly because of the use of mores, and partly because these
verses interrupt the simile in caprolaot and morbum.

85. quod: so Mss. Leo reads qui after Scaliger.

96, Thus Lindsay, accepting the corrections of Reiz and Bothe.

10³. dici discrucior: this correction by Ritschl of the dicis
excrucior of the Mss. is accepted by Leo.

168. inscribit: Leo reads inscripsit after Nonius.

185. Skutsch proposes eme meam, eta, eme being (presumably)
the original form of em (Philolopua 59, 500).

186. So Lindsay, adhering to A. Leo reads: hoscine propter
res maledicos samos ferunt.

192. fil: Leo adheres to flet (Α).

223-300. Leo's arrangement of this canticum is followed in this
edition. For a discussion of it, see Leo's Die plautinischen Cantica ’
und die lullonistische Lyrik (Berlin, 1897).

238 α. Lindsay adheres to A, reading cos petil, eos sectatur.

2³9. Lindsay retains subdolo blanditur.

¹Studemund's famous apograph of this Ms. has been consulted
throughout by the editor.

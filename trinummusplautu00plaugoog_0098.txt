NOTES

ARGUMENTUM

This acrostic oryumeatum (statement of plot), like similar
productione in other plays, was probably composed early in the
imperial period. lt is not the work oi Plautus.

1. thensaurum: archaic form ior thesaurum (from encarpis),
trecrore. — abstrusum Ι abiens: the hiatus is probably an affected
archaism, in imitation of similar cases in the Plautine plays.

4. et = etiam,· nota Plautine use.

5. poscitur: sc. in matrimonium.

6. minus quo cum inuidia, ete: thot without odium Callicles
may pice lter a dowry ; minus quo is used for quo minore (inuidia).
For the scansion of mines, see Introduction, 516.

T. mandat qui dicat: lte commissione one to say,· sc. eum. '

8. ut uenit: ie. the messenger.

9. ut rediit: ie. Charmides. - quoius nubunt liberi: liis elul·
drea wcd. The liberi are the son and daughter oi Charmides.
For the plot, see Introduction, 546.

PROLOGUE

The prologues to the plays of Plautus are, ior the most part,
spurious, having been composed at a time when the old plays
were revived for the stage. The prologue to the Trinummas,
however, is skillfully designed and may well be genuine. Itis
the only one in which two speakers appear.

1. hac: titis way. -gnata=ncto; this archaia form is used
even by virgil-munus iungaris: suaper always takes the ac-
cusative in Plautus. So too abutor, but utor and fruor take the ab·
lative; potior takes accusative, ablatlve, or genitive; vescor does
not occur in Plautus.

2. finem: ie. of our Journey. - quem dicam: indirect question.

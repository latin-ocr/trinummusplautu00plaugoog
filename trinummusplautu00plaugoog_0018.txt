4. These plays show a great variety in subjeotmatter,
characters, tone 01 thought, and construction of plot, due to
the natural versatility 01 the author and the extreme free-
dom with which he handled his models These he abridged
or extended as he pleased, and though his characters and the
soenes which form the baokground 01 his plays are all Greek,
yet he has introduced such a large Roman elernent that the
Latin comedies are evidently cast in a very different rnould
from his Greek originale. The very titles 01 his plays are
mainly Latin, and from Latin are taken the names 01 001-
tain 01 his charactere, ey. the parasites 80111110,Ρο1110111110,
and Curculio His personages are familiar with Rome and
Italy 3 we find allusions to Roman custodis, laws, institutione
officiale, gemes, colonieS, and contemporary history. His

language, 100, shows much independenoe 01 his originals. It ,

, abounds in distinctly Roman metaphora and similes, in plays
on words, striking alliterations, assonances, and other pecul-
iarly idiomatic expressions, such as cannot be the result 01
translation, but must belong to Plautus alone.¹ PlautuS,
with his fluent style, his wealth 01 words, and natural ease
01 expression, has left us the greatest storehouse 01 Latin
popular speech, the 0011110 1101911110, as contrasted with the
more artificial literary style, or conuocaturum. At the same
time Plautus delights in reproduoing sonre 01 the idiomatic
features which he finds in the language 01 his originale. He
imports bodily Greek words and phraseS,2 and almost out-
does Aristophanes 111 coining extravagant patronyrnios and
other derivativas, as well as grotesque mouth-filling oom-
pounds³ 10 which the Greek readily lends itself.
